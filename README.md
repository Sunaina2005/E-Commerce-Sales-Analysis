## Problem Statement

This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of e-commerce sales data. It helps businesses understand sales trends across different product categories, markets, and shipping methods. Key insights include regional sales performance, preferred shipping modes, and the contribution of various product categories to overall revenue. The dashboard is designed to empower businesses with actionable insights, enabling them to optimize operations, reduce shipping costs, and target high-performing markets.

The dashboard reveals that sales are concentrated in a few key markets, and shipping preferences are largely focused on standard and second-class services. By identifying patterns in customer preferences and operational performance, businesses can refine their strategies to improve profitability and customer satisfaction.
